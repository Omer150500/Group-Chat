# Group-Chat
This project is a client-side chat application written in Python, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. It enables users to connect to a chat server, send and receive real-time messages, and interact with other participants in a user-friendly environment.
Features
User-Friendly GUI: A clean and responsive interface built with Tkinter.
Real-Time Chat: Send and receive messages instantly using sockets.
Username Support: Users can set a custom name before connecting to the server.
Message Display: Chat messages are displayed in a dedicated, read-only text box.
Error Handling: Provides user feedback in case of connection issues.

Project Architecture
socket: Handles communication with the server using TCP sockets.
threading: Manages real-time message receiving in a separate thread.
tkinter: Provides the graphical user interface for the application.
Code Overview
Key Components
GUI Creation:
The graphical interface includes text fields for displaying messages, input fields for sending messages, and buttons for user actions.
Socket Communication:
Establishes a TCP connection to the server.
Sends and receives messages via sockets.
Multithreading:
A background thread listens for incoming messages without blocking the GUI.
Main Functions
connect_to_server: Connects to the server and initializes the username.
receive_messages: Runs in a separate thread to handle incoming messages.
send_message: Sends user-inputted messages to the server.
update_chat_box: Updates the chat box with new messages.
Future Improvements
Message Encryption: Add secure message encryption using SSL/TLS for enhanced privacy.
Server Deployment: Provide a server implementation for users to host their own chat servers.
Enhanced Error Handling: Improve feedback for issues like server downtime or invalid input.
Custom Themes: Add support for customizable UI themes.
